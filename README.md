## Welcome!

Hello! I'm Jacob. I'm a data scientist/economist. A lot of my work is focused on the design and analysis of experiments to improve decision making. For example, trying to understand the impact of formalizing land tenure rights in Tanzania through [digitial land certificates](https://github.com/jacobpstein/jacobpstein/blob/main/PA00XBMP.pdf) or understanding what changes in subscription rates are the result of seasonality or product upgrades. In my day job these days, I use Bayesian models and descriptive statistics to gain a deeper understanding of customer interests and behavior in youth sports. 

A brief list of stuff I like to work on:

- Food and basketball
- Web scraping to get data on everything from maize imports in Zambia to shot selection for the Wizards
- Causal inference
- Thoughtful descriptive analysis

# Some projects to highlight 
- - **[The Graph that Haunts Me]([https://github.com/jacobpstein/tidytuesday](https://0196f5d5-dc61-3977-66b7-ccd1e7b9cead.share.connect.posit.cloud/#/title-slide))**: Presentation delivered to the DC Data Science Community Meet-up about how metrics, even ones we use and cite, can be simultaneously flawed and unavoidable.
- - **[Bayes Dash]([https://github.com/jacobpstein/pii](https://019bf696-ea03-7d75-9b41-cce49a0ebf59.share.connect.posit.cloud))**: developed to help teach colleagues Stan and to explain prior distributions.
- - **[Math for Data Science](https://github.com/jacobpstein/math_for_ds)**: repo with python code for the concepts, exercises, and lessons from the excellent [Essential Math for Data Science by Thomas Nield](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/essential-math-for/9781098102920/). I started this just to force myself to work through the book, but it ended up being pretty fun.
- - **[Wizards Points](https://github.com/jacobpstein/Wizards-Points)**: repo for my NBA [Substack](https://wizardspoints.substack.com) heavy on data viz
