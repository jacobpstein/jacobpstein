## Welcome!

Hello! I'm Jacob. I'm a data scientist/economist. A lot of my work is focused on the design and analysis of experiments to improve decision making. For example, trying to understand the impact of formalizing land tenure rights in Tanzania through [digitial land certificates](https://github.com/jacobpstein/jacobpstein/blob/main/PA00XBMP.pdf) or understanding what changes in subscription rates are the result of seasonality or product upgrades. In my day job these days, I use Bayesian models and descriptive statistics to gain a deeper understanding of customer interests and behavior in youth sports. 

A brief list of stuff I like to work on:

- Food and basketball
- Web scraping to get data on everything from maize imports in Zambia to shot selection for the Wizards
- Causal inference
- Thoughtful descriptive analysis

# Some projects to highlight 
- - **[TidyTuesday repo](https://github.com/jacobpstein/tidytuesday)**: One data set, one hour. A repo with whatever I manage to do in that time.
- - **[pii R package](https://github.com/jacobpstein/pii)**: developed to help flag potential personal information in survey data sets.
- - **[Math for Data Science](https://github.com/jacobpstein/math_for_ds)**: repo with python code for the concepts, exercises, and lessons from the excellent [Essential Math for Data Science by Thomas Nield](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/essential-math-for/9781098102920/). I started this just to force myself to work through the book, but it ended up being pretty fun.
- - **[Wizards Points](https://github.com/jacobpstein/Wizards-Points)**: repo for my NBA [Substack](https://wizardspoints.substack.com) heavy on data viz
